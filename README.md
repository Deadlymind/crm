## Project Overview

This document outlines the development, implementation, and deployment of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and an email campaign automation solution for SMP France. The project aims to improve efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and provide deeper insights into sales performance and client interactions.

## Project Goals

- Develop a robust CRM system for managing client information, tracking interactions, and automating sales tasks.
- Implement an email campaign automation tool to streamline keyword-based research, data scraping, and campaign management.
- Integrate advanced reporting and analytics features to provide actionable insights.
- Ensure scalability, security, and user-friendliness of the system.

## Project Scope

### CRM System
- **User Management**: Authentication, role-based access control, and user profile management.
- **Client Data Entry**: Forms and views for adding, updating, and viewing client information.
- **Task Automation**: Scheduling tasks, sending notifications, and tracking sales activities.
- **Reporting**: Generating and visualizing sales reports.

### Email Campaign Automation
- **Keyword-Based Research**: Searching for relevant URLs based on keywords.
- **Data Scraping**: Extracting email data from web pages.
- **File Generation**: Compiling scraped data into CSV/Excel files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Validating and cleaning email data.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React & Next.js or HTML , CSS & JS 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Automation**: Celery, Redis
- **Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Visualization**: Chart.js, D3.js
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of a Django backend, React/Next.js frontend, and PostgreSQL database. Celery and Redis handle task automation, while BeautifulSoup and Scrapy are used for data scraping. Visualization tools like Chart.js and D3.js provide advanced reporting features.
